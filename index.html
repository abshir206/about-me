    About Abshir
  </h1>

    <p> My name is Abshir Ibrahim. I am 27 years old and i'm born and raised in Seattle, Washington. I studied marketing at the University of Washington. During my time there i held many different internships at companies such as Microsoft and AT&T. I then ended up working in sales but i didn't like it. I left that career to come to Code Fellows to learn the skills neccesary for me to become a great software developer.
